		<p>Steamed rice is a basic staple food that is simple and easy to prepare. To make steamed rice, rice grains are washed and soaked in water for about 30 minutes. The soaked rice is then drained and placed in a pot with a measured amount of water. The rice is cooked over low heat until all the water has been absorbed, and the rice is tender and fluffy. The pot is then removed from the heat and allowed to sit for a few minutes before being fluffed with a fork. Steamed rice is a versatile dish that can be served with a variety of dishes and cuisines, and it is a great addition to any meal.</p>
