		<p>An omelet is a classic dish made by beating eggs with salt and pepper and cooking them in a skillet until set. 
		It can be served plain or filled with a variety of ingredients such as cheese, vegetables, or meat. Omelets are a versatile dish 
		that can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and are popular all around the world. They are quick and easy to make and
		 can be customized to suit any taste or dietary preference. Whether served as a simple dish or dressed up with fancy ingredients,
		  omelets are a delicious and satisfying meal that are sure to please.</p>
		 <p>Ingredients:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2-3 large eggs</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
			<li>Optional fillings (e.g. cheese, ham, vegetables)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Instructions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Crack the eggs into a small mixing bowl and beat them lightly with a fork or whisk. Season with salt and pepper to 
			taste.</li>
			<li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and swirl it around the pan until it melts and starts 
			to foam.</li>
			<li>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet and let them cook undisturbed for a few seconds until the bottom starts to set.</li>
			<li>Use a spatula to gently lift the edges of the omelet and let the uncooked eggs flow underneath. Repeat this process
			 until the top of the omelet is mostly set but still slightly runny.</li>
			<li>Add any desired fillings to one half of the omelet, then use the spatula to fold the other half over the top of the 
			fillings. Cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the fillings are heated through and the eggs are fully set.</li>
			<li>Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve immediately.</li>
			<li>Note: You can adjust the cooking time and temperature to your preference. Some people like their omelets fully cooked,
			 while others prefer them slightly runny in the middle. You can also experiment with different fillings, such as sautéed 
			 mushrooms, diced tomatoes, or cooked bacon.</li>
