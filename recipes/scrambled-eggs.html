		<p>Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast dish made by whisking eggs and cooking them in a pan until they form soft, fluffy curds. They can be made plain with just a pinch of salt and pepper, or customized with a variety of fillings such as cheese, herbs, or vegetables. The texture and flavor of scrambled eggs can be adjusted to personal taste by varying the cooking time and temperature. Proper technique involves continuously stirring or folding the eggs as they cook to create a creamy and tender texture. Scrambled eggs are a versatile dish that can be enjoyed on their own or as a component of a larger breakfast spread.</p>
