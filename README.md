# Project: Recipes
In this project I am going to build a simple recipe website.
# How it works
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. No CSS applied yet.
# Sitemap
/index.html  
/recipes/  
/recipes/guacamole.html  
/recipes/omelet.html  
/recipes/pasta.html  
/recipes/scrambled-eggs.html  
/recipes/steamed-rice.html  
# Applied skills
